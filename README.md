# 🧠🖼️ AI-Powered Image Caption Generation

This project implements an **AI-powered image caption generator** that automatically generates descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. It combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image feature extraction and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **Transformers** for language modeling.
